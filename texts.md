## Section: About the coffee shop

About the coffee shop

Our coffee shop is located in the Practicum Library's hall. It features 6 tables and free WiFi.

Our main mission is keeping guests cozy and energized.

Besides that, we try to reduce our environmental impact — so we don't sell single-use cups. But you can buy one of our reusable cups!
